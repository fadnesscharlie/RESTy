# RESTy

This application is a way for users to understand a REST api and see the documented methods, API, and results they are given.

## Usage

The user will be able to enter an API which they will hit, choose a method, and get back the results
The method of which the user has chosen will be saved in a history box so they can view their past searches and re-populate the form with past user entries.
